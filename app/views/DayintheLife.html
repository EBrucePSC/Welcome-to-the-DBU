      <p>This page is intended to talk about the key skills a joiner who works
         on a dbu project might learn as compared to the other BUs. It could
         introduce the idea of software prototyping as well as the basics of the GDS.
       Finally, it may want to talk about general company structure, e.g. ACs work projects for several BUs whilst senior managers specialise.</p>
