        A day in the life of a consultant on a DBU project
      </h1>

      <p>Our day to day ways of working tend to be similar to other buissness units, utilising the 'Agile' framework of daily stand-ups and weekly reflections. </p>
      <p> Generalist consultants are needed throughout DBU projects but their biggest involvement is often at the beta stage: </P>
         <p>Here they might design some basic services, like this one, based on ideas developed in the alpha stage.
        They might also run some service testing,
        speaking to users to make sure whatever is built suits their needs. </P>
      <p>  Other key skills, like project managment and communicating with software developers,
         are also required on beta projects alongside
        more conventional consulting techniques like problem solving and client influencing. </p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Software we use</h3>
        <p> Unlike other buissness units the DBU primarily operates on google drive rather than boxnote.
          This aids in communicating with our clients and developers. We also use a site called Jira to
           help our team perform projects using the agile framework. You will need to be added to a DBU team to get access to this.</p>
             <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Jira example</h3>
