      <p>A digital audit examines the current digital landscape asking users questions like:</p>
      <P> what services do you know about?</p>
        <p> What services do you use?</p>
          <p> What could they do better?</p>
  <p> We then make recommendations about where organisations can make the biggest impacts by changing the digital services they offer.
     In some cases, this can lead clients back to our other digital services.</p>
  <P> In 2022 we conducted a digital audit on behalf of the Welsh government. To read what they made of our findings click the link below: </p>
