        Who we are
      </h1>

      <p> In 2021 The PSC split into 3 buissness units one of which was the DBU. We help public sector clients with an array of digital needs,
        helping them adapt to a rapidly changing digital landscape.
         Currently any consultant might be drafted onto a DBU project, or asked
         to help us win bids, but we have a few permanent managers and partners. </p>
